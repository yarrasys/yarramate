# Changelog

## 0.18.0

- Resolve `attestations[].by` as a subject reference, reusing `YM304` when it
  does not resolve, instead of accepting free text: an authority has to be
  someone the model already knows (ADR 0082). Documents whose `by` is a name
  rather than a reference no longer compile.
- Add optional `attestations[].recordedBy` naming whoever held the pen.
  `apply` requires it on every attestation an operations batch writes, since a
  batch is by construction a machine's transcription of someone's judgment.
- Report `unconfirmed-attestation` from `reconcile`, with a matching
  `summary.unconfirmedAttestations` counter, when a record names a recorder
  other than its attesting authority. Advisory like `stale-attestation`:
  `check --strict` is unaffected.
- Render the recorder beside the authority in `export rtm` attestation cells.

## 0.17.0

- Add the `yarramate-visual` adapter (beta): a sibling runtime that renders
  LikeC4 diagrams of a bounded slice in a local, authenticated browser
  session and delegates a chat conversation about what is on screen to a
  visual agent, over a published, closed `yarramate/visual-*/v1` contract.
  Git review remains responsible for accepting any resulting architecture
  proposal; the runtime never becomes canonical architecture by itself.

## 0.16.0

- Add optional profile concept-kind layers and layer-aware projections.
- Add bounded, directional connected expansion and deterministic presentation metadata.
